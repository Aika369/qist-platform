## Works

**Opportunities** — `opportunities.html`
20 structured opportunities, 17 of them open, with filters, search, expiry handling and
URL-shareable state.
Every card carries an eligibility verdict for the visitor's country and career stage, with
a link to the source the verdict came from. No match percentages: none are calibrated yet.

**Match analysis** — `QIST.matchOpportunity()`
Every opportunity card now carries a score, a sentence and the rows the score was counted from.
The number is **requirements met out of requirements this call actually states** — counted, not
predicted, and every line is checkable against the funder's page. A requirement the call does not
state (no deadline, open to all fields) is not counted, so a three-condition call is scored out of
three. Country, career stage and an open deadline are blocking: fail one and the verdict says you
cannot apply, whatever the percentage looks like. The card says in plain words that this is **not**
a chance of winning — we have no response data, so a weighted prediction would be a guess dressed
as a number (D-07, D-33). A language model can sit on top of this breakdown once the backend
exists; it will not replace the count.

The separate "Academic matching" page is gone from the footer: matching is a property of the
search, not a section of the site (D-37).

**Eligibility engine** — `QIST.checkCountry()`
All 250 ISO countries, four Horizon Europe statuses (EU member / associated / funded /
self-funded). Verdicts are read from `data/eligibility.json`, never computed by a model.
A funder that publishes its own country list now overrides the programme table, carrying
its own source link: Faculty for the Future takes Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
Turkmenistan but **not** Kazakhstan; the TWAS developing-countries list has no Georgia or
Armenia. Both were checked against the funders' own documents on 2026-09-18.

**Curator screen** — `curate.html`
Adding an opportunity no longer means editing JSON by hand. The screen validates against the
same rules the site uses — an external call cannot be saved without a link to the funder's
page, a country list cannot be saved without the source it came from, duplicate ids and
unknown country codes are caught before saving — then hands back the finished
`data/opportunities.json` to commit. It needs no backend. Linked from `admin.html`.

**Navigation** — Home · Opportunities · Researchers · For organizations · About QIST
Map and globe are views inside Researchers, not sections. Matching is not in public
navigation: it is personal and belongs behind sign-in. "For organizations" is the only
audience item on the site, and it is a deliberate exception (D-27).

**For organizations** — `organizations.html`
One page, two readings: a switch at the top — **company first** — rewrites the page and tags every
submission with `audience`, so the data decides later whether to split it.

Researchers appear here **anonymously**: research field, seniority band, country. Name, title,
organisation, city and public link are not rendered and are not in the DOM, and searching by name
returns nothing. An open named list would hand over the only asset QIST has — an organisation reads
it once, finds those people elsewhere and never comes back (D-34). A name reaches an organisation
only after that member agrees to a specific introduction.
Three things a visitor can actually do:

1. **Post a need** — an R&D problem, a vacancy, a consortium partner or a single expert
   question. It reaches a curator, who publishes it in Opportunities with the organisation
   named. Nothing appears on the site automatically.
2. **See what expertise is in the network** — a real search across all 497 records by field,
   country and topic, returning anonymous capability cards. "Request an introduction" opens
   inline and states, before anything is sent, that the name and contact reach the organisation
   only if that researcher agrees.
3. **Book 30 minutes** — a discovery call. The page says plainly there is nothing to buy.

A block at the bottom lists what does not exist yet — no organisation accounts, no verified
badges, no paid product — and its counters are computed from the data at load time, so they
cannot rot into a lie.

**Create profile** — `login.html`
The header button says "Create profile" and now does it: without a backend it collects a real
request through Formspree and a curator creates the profile by hand. It does not ask for a
password, because there is nowhere to keep one.

**Home page** — `index.html`
Rebuilt. "What you can do here" repeated the navigation, "Latest opportunities" was a weaker copy
of the real page without verdicts, and "Featured researchers" paraded six names chosen by an
unexplained flag — which contradicted the rule that organizations see no names at all. In their
place: a live eligibility check on three open calls that reacts to the country and stage you pick,
two clearly separated doors (researcher / organization), and the depth of the network by research
field with no names. The three calls are chosen to exercise different edges of the check, because
the three closing soonest all happened to be open to any nationality and the demonstration
demonstrated nothing (D-39).

**Data provenance — corrected**
The site used to say the directory was "compiled from public sources: university pages, Google
Scholar and open researcher profiles". That was **wrong**, and wrong in an expensive direction: it
described collection without consent where consent exists. Everyone in the directory is a QIST
member who joined the association themselves and supplied these details. Fixed on `about.html`,
`organizations.html`, the README and here (D-35). B-34 is to reconcile the 497 records against the
membership register and record a joining date, so the claim can be backed up.

**Honesty fixes**
- Hard-coded admin credentials removed from the public JS *and* from the sign-in page text.
- Sign-in, registration and the admin console disable themselves without a backend,
  instead of writing fake accounts into the visitor's own browser.
- Home page counters: `497 / 42 / 902 / 13` → `492 / 41 / 32 / 7`.
- `geo_precision` on every directory record: 338 hold a country centroid, and that is now
  visible on the map, in the directory and on the globe rather than shown as a real address.
- 5 probable duplicate records flagged, not deleted.

**Language** — the whole interface and all opportunity data are in English.
Researchers' own names are left exactly as recorded.

## Limits — know these before launch

1. **`INTEREST_ENDPOINT`, `SIGNUP_ENDPOINT`, `CONTACT_EMAIL` are empty.** Until they are set,
   no response and no email address is collected at all. Formspree setup: README.
   Tally does not work for this — see D-17.
2. **`CONTACT_EMAIL` is the most urgent of the three**: 492 people are published with no
   working way to ask for removal.
3. **Eligibility lists were extracted by automated reading of the EC PDF.** One earlier read
   of the same document was wrong about three countries. Have a human spot-check the nine
   priority countries and record it in `eligibility.json` → `verification.reviewed_by` (B-18).
4. **17 active opportunities, not 100.** Still the product's real bottleneck, not the code.
   Ten calls were added on 2026-09-19, each read from the funder's own page: ERC Starting and
   Consolidator 2027, MSCA Doctoral Networks 2026, COST Open Call 2026, Erasmus+ Capacity
   Building, Faculty for the Future, Humboldt Research Fellowship, TWAS–FAPESP, NATO SPS and
   IIE-SRF. Several strong candidates were checked and **left out** because they had already
   closed (MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships and COFUND, MSCA Staff Exchanges, Digital GreenTalents,
   TÜBİTAK 2216, L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science) or because none of the nine countries
   qualify (TWAS-SISSA-Lincei is for least developed countries only). That filtering is the
   slow part of curation, and it is what the curator screen exists to keep honest.
5. **Backend is written but not deployed.** Opportunities are edited in a JSON file and reach
   the site by commit.
6. **Cities for 338 records are not recovered** — no geocoder reachable from the dev sandbox.
7. **10 directory records have no country and no organisation** and cannot be matched (B-19).

## Verified

183 automated checks in headless Chromium across `test.mjs` (22), `test2.mjs` (18),
`test3.mjs` (19), `test4.mjs` (16), `test5.mjs` (30), `test6.mjs` (38) and `test7.mjs` (40). Covering: eligibility verdicts across two programmes and nine countries,
filters, empty and error states, expired entries, button behaviour with no endpoint
configured, absence of the admin password anywhere in the build, honest counters, coordinate
precision labels, the full 250-country selector, English-only interface text, and no
horizontal scroll at 390px. No JavaScript errors.

`test5.mjs` additionally runs every record in the data file through the site's own validator,
checks that the funder country lists produce the right verdict with the right source link, and
drives the curator screen end to end — empty form blocked, duplicate id caught, unknown country
code caught, country list without a source rejected, record saved, draft surviving a reload,
reset back to the committed file. It found three real defects on its first run: two records
carrying `country: "OTHER"` instead of an ISO code, and 529px of horizontal scroll on the new
screen at phone width. All three are fixed.

`test6.mjs` covers the organizations page against a local receiver, because formspree.io is
unreachable from the sandbox: it checks that all four submission kinds (`org_need`,
`org_introduction`, `org_conversation`, `profile_request`) actually leave the browser with the
right body and the `Accept: application/json` header Formspree needs, that a malformed email
sends nothing at all, and that no researcher contact detail is in any payload. It also proves the
anonymity by comparing the rendered DOM against the source data — no name, organisation, city or
link of any shown researcher appears anywhere in the markup, and a search for a real name returns
nothing.

`test7.mjs` runs 80 score calculations across four reader profiles and asserts that the numerator,
the denominator and the percentage agree, that a requirement the call does not state never enters
the denominator, and that a blocking failure overrides a high percentage. It also checks the brand
lockup by computed style rather than by eye, the footer links against the header, and that the
corrected provenance wording is actually on the pages.

`L is not defined` on map.html appears only in the sandbox, where unpkg.com is blocked.
Leaflet loads on the live site — checked 2026-09-14. **The country-marker logic on the map
is therefore not covered by automated tests; please look at it after deploying.**

## Deploy — read this first

A release is **one set of files that must go up together**. The 2026-09-18 incident: the three
HTML files reached the server but `assets/js/app.js`, `data/eligibility.json` and
`data/opportunities.json` did not. The page called a helper that was not there, threw, and
rendered blank with no explanation.

Two things changed because of it:

- `opportunities.html` now checks its dependencies and, if they are stale, says which file is
  out of date instead of showing an empty page.
- When you upload a release, upload **every file in the zip**, including the `assets/` and
  `data/` folders. Dragging only the changed HTML is what caused this.

## Live check, 2026-09-18

Verified directly against `aika369.github.io/qist-platform/opportunities.html`:
build `2026-09-18d` served, 7 cards, 250 countries in two groups, 35 research fields,
no deploy-guard message. The site works. The earlier "page is newer than the files"
message came from a browser cache holding the previous `app.js`.

## What is blocked on the backend

Three things asked for in the last review cannot be built on GitHub Pages, because there is nowhere
to keep files or passwords:

- **Organization sign-up and sign-in** with a stored profile (B-31).
- **Researcher profile editing, avatar upload, CV upload** and building a profile from the CV
  (B-30). CV parsing is server-side by necessity: a model key cannot live in the browser.
- **A language model on top of the match breakdown** (B-32).

Everything else from that review is done. The backend (B-29) is now the single blocker for the
rest, and it needs decisions only you can make: hosting account, who pays for it, which domain.

## Next

1. **Confirm the response path works.** Click **Interested** on the live site and check that the
   submission appears in the Formspree dashboard. That is the first real metric this product has
   ever produced, and nothing else on this list matters until it works.
2. **Curate weekly, not once.** Open `curate.html`, add what you find, download the file, commit.
   Twenty records is a demo; a hundred with live deadlines is a product. Three entries are already
   expired — B-21 is the habit of checking them, not a feature.
3. **Answer the new inbox.** The organizations page promises a reply within two working days.
   Decide who reads `org_need`, `org_introduction`, `org_conversation` and `profile_request`,
   and how fast (B-25). An unanswered promise is noticed on the first submission.
4. **Ten to fifteen conversations with universities** (B-26). That is what this page exists for,
   and what the paid product has to be built on.
5. **B-18 is still open.** The nine countries' Horizon Europe statuses have not been checked by a
   human against the EC PDF. One automated read of that document was already wrong about three of
   them.
